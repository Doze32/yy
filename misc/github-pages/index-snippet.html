<p><em>Album</em> is a browser extension that detects the images on the current page and shows them in a list that can be exported in three different formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A simple <strong>list</strong> of absolute URLs pointing at the images.</p></li>
<li><p>An HTML snippet with <code>img</code> tags forming a <strong>mosaic</strong>. Images can also export their original links.</p></li>
<li><p>An HTML snippet that creates a <strong>carousel</strong> powered by <a href="http://galleria.io">Galleria.io</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, the data is copied into the clipboard and can be inserted into any text editor by pressing <code>Ctrl+V</code>. Mosaic and carousel snippets can be inserted into documents, blog posts, virtual learning environments or any other application based on HTML content. Before pasting the code into a rich-text editor, be sure to set it in <em>plain text</em> mode (usually represented by a button with the symbols <code>&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>html</code>).</p>
<p>This is a free software project. You can contribute to improving this browser extension by reporting <a href="https://github.com/projectestac/album/issues">issues</a>, translating it into other languages or sending <a href="https://github.com/projectestac/album/pulls">pull requests</a>. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p><em>Album</em> is currently implemented for Chrome/Chromium and can be installed directly from the <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/album/obknigmaekkacdkckfeegcfiefdaeked">Chrome Web Store</a></strong>. We want to implement it also for <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> in the future (developers help wanted!)</p>
<p>Special thanks to the excellent work done by <strong><a href="http://galleria.io">Galleria.io</a></strong>, the open source engine beneath the image carousel. In addition to the basic free theme used by <em>Album</em>, they provide also with other nice and featured themes at cheap prices.</p>
<p>Note that <em>Album</em> does not copy images nor any type of files: it just deals with URLs pointing at remote resources. Issues with the images (slow loading, file not found...) are often related to problems with the origin of the images.</p>
<p>This project was developed in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It makes use of three open-source libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a> by The JQuery Foundation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lgarron/clipboard.js">clipboard.js</a> by Lucas Garron</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getmdl.io">Material Design Lite</a> by Google</li>
</ul>
<p>All these components can be obtained with <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>. To download its latest releases install Bower on your system and launch <code>bower update</code> from the project's root folder. Components will then be placed into <code>/bower_components</code> and referenced by symbolic links from <code>/chrome/lib</code>.</p>
